Codebook for Course Project for Getting and Cleansing Data

# Summary
This codebook accompanies the file TidyData.txt, which provides summarized mean and standard deviation outputs from the transformation of the UCI Human Activity Recognition data set. The data covers a number of subjects and activities
across walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying

An observation within the tidy data file represents a of subject's ID, the name of the associated activity, and the means of record results representing mean and standard deviation activity measures for the HAR data set.
